There are 2 types of caching that come with the blueprint framework

- Page caching

	This allows you to cache the entire output of the page (usually
	run from the controller) like so:
		
		$page_caching->startCachingFile();
		
	Once all the actions are complete, call:
	
		$page_caching->stopCachingFile();
		
	Next time the page is called, the startCachingFile() method will 
	check to see if a cache file has already been created and serve
	that instead.

- Fragment caching
	
	This allows you to cache the output from a method like so:
		
		//do some hardcore processing here
		
		$cache->set('class.method', $value);
		
	This will store the value in /tmp/fragment-cache, Next time the
	method is run you can check to see if the cache is already 
	primed to save having to do the processing again:
	
		if ($value = $cache->get('class.method'))
			return $value;
			
	When a piece of data changes you will need to remove the old 
	cache like so
	
		$cache->clear('class.method');
			
All the options for turning the caches on or off and setting their 
expiry times, are located in /etc/config.php under defaults
